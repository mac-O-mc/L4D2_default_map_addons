# L4D2: Default Maps Addons
Like the title, this repo's an assortment of various L4D2 VScript addons to the default maps

The scripts are to be put in `/scripts/vscripts/`. You can setup your own custom folder too, but I won't go into that unless its wanted.

In the sourcemod folder is a copy of `vscript_replacer.cfg` for ease in Sourcemod integration
