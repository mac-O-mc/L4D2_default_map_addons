# Sourcemod Extras
In here will contain a custom `vscript_replacer.cfg` file if you wish to let the plugin do the work instead of downloading all scripts here.

Note, these scripts are not in the cfg file for reasons such as being too different, so install them in a custom folder instead. I will not explain how to make one here, so go online for resources on how to do this and resources on `gameinfo.txt`.
## Unincluded scripts
* c14m2_gauntlet
